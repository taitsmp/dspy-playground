    "\n",
    "Whatever the task, the general workflow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collect a little bit of data.** Define examples of the inputs and outputs of your program (e.g., questions and their answers). This could just be a handful of quick examples you wrote down. If large datasets exist, the more the merrier!\n",
    "1. **Write your program.** Define the modules (i.e., sub-tasks) of your program and the way they should interact together to solve your task.\n",
    "1. **Define some validation logic.** What makes for a good run of your program? Maybe the answers need to have a certain length or stick to a particular format? Specify the logic that checks that.\n",
    "1. **Compile!** Ask DSPy to compile your program using your data. The compiler will use your data and validation logic to optimize your program (e.g., prompts and modules) so it's efficient and effective!\n",
    "1. **Iterate.** Repeat the process by improving your data, program, validation, or by using more advanced features of the DSPy compiler."

The premise of the series is that within two days and on a budget of $10,000, celebrity chef Robert Irvine renovates a failing American restaurant with the goal of helping to restore it to profitability and prominence. Irvine is assisted by a designer (usually Taniya Nayak, Cheryl Torrenueva, or Lynn Keagan, but sometimes Vanessa De Leon, Krista Watterworth, Yvette Irene, or Nicole Faccuito), along with general contractor Tom Bury, who sometimes does double duty as both general contractor and designer. After assessing the problems with the restaurant, Robert Irvine typically creates a plan for the new decor, oversees the cleaning of the restaurant, reduces the size of the menu and improves the food, develops a promotional activity, educates the restaurant's owners, or trains the staff, as needed by each restaurant. \n",
